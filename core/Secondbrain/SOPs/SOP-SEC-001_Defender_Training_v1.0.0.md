## 1.0 Purpose

To establish a standardized process for conducting Microsoft Defender Attack Training Simulations for clients. The primary objectives of this procedure are:
- To educate client personnel on the identification and risks of phishing emails.
- To demonstrate the capabilities and operation of the Microsoft Defender Attack Simulation tool.
- To collaboratively plan, schedule, and execute attack simulations.
- To review simulation results and provide actionable recommendations for improving security posture.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all IT personnel involved in the planning and execution of client-facing security training initiatives. It specifically governs the Microsoft Defender Attack Training Simulation sessions conducted for clients and their designated security and technical teams.

## 3.0 Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Presenter (Phishing Identification)** | Responsible for developing and delivering the educational presentation on identifying phishing attempts, including real-world examples and best practices. |
| **Presenter (Simulation Overview)** | Responsible for presenting the overview, benefits, and demonstration of the Microsoft Defender Attack Simulation platform. |
| **Moderator/Facilitator** | Responsible for leading the training session, managing the agenda, facilitating discussions, and ensuring session objectives are met. |
| **Client Representative(s)** | Responsible for collaborating on the scheduling and structure of simulations, providing relevant technical context, and participating in the training. |
| **All Participants** | Responsible for confirming availability for the scheduled session and reviewing any pre-shared materials. |

## 4.0 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Phishing** | A fraudulent attempt, usually made through email, to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. |
| **Attack Simulation** | A feature within Microsoft Defender used to run realistic, benign cyberattack scenarios (e.g., phishing campaigns) within an organization to test security policies and employee awareness. |

## 5.0 Procedure

### 5.1 Phase 1: Preparation and Scheduling

1.  **Identify Participants:** The Moderator will identify and list the key participants from both the internal team and the client's team.
2.  **Propose Dates:** The Moderator will propose a minimum of three potential dates for the training session to the client.
3.  **Finalize Schedule:** Based on participant feedback and client convenience, the Moderator will finalize and confirm the session date and time.
4.  **Collaborate on Logistics:** The Moderator and Presenters will engage with the client's technical team to discuss the initial structure, focus areas, and goals for the attack simulation.
5.  **Prepare Materials:** The designated Presenters will prepare their respective presentation materials (Phishing Identification and Defender Simulation Overview).
6.  **Distribute Materials:** The Moderator will share the agenda and any relevant presentation materials with all participants ahead of the scheduled session.

### 5.2 Phase 2: Training Session Execution

The training session will follow the structured agenda below:

**Part 1: Welcome and Introductions (10 min)**
   - The Moderator officially starts the meeting and welcomes all attendees.
   - Each participant briefly introduces themselves and their role.
   - The Moderator reviews the objectives and agenda for the session.

**Part 2: Presentation on Identifying Phishing Emails (20 min)**
   - The designated Presenter conducts a detailed presentation covering:
     - Key characteristics and red flags of phishing emails.
     - Analysis of real-world phishing examples.
     - Actionable tips and best practices for employees to recognize and report phishing attempts.

**Part 3: Presentation on Microsoft Defender Attack Simulation (20 min)**
   - The designated Presenter conducts a presentation and demonstration covering:
     - An overview of the attack simulation concept and its value.
     - The operational mechanics and benefits of the Microsoft Defender tool.
     - A live demonstration of how to configure and set up a new simulation.

**Part 4: Collaborative Simulation Workshop (60 min)**
   - The Moderator facilitates a collaborative working session with the client team.
   - **Action:** Collaboratively schedule the first official attack simulation.
   - **Action:** Define the structure, payloads, and target groups for the simulation.
   - **Action:** Establish a timeline and cadence for future, ongoing training sessions.

**Part 5: Initial Simulation Results Review (20 min, *if applicable*)**
   - If a preliminary simulation has been conducted, the Presenter will share the initial results.
   - The team will discuss the implications of the findings and potential areas for improvement.
   - A Q&A session is held to address any questions regarding the results.

**Part 6: Wrap-Up and Next Steps (10 min)**
   - The Moderator summarizes the key decisions and takeaways from the session.
   - The Moderator confirms the schedule for the first simulation and any subsequent follow-up sessions.
