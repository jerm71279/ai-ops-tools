## Usage

The link clusters show **hub notes** (central documents) with their related notes. You can:

1. **Navigate in Obsidian:** Use the `[[note name]]` format to create internal links
2. **Build knowledge graphs:** Connect related concepts across teams
3. **Find documentation:** Quickly locate related policies, configs, or contracts
4. **Cross-team collaboration:** See where teams overlap (e.g., IT Services + Engineering on network security)

## Next Steps

1. Review the clusters in `team_clusters_output.txt`
2. Manually create important links in your most-used hub notes
3. Consider creating team-specific dashboards in Obsidian
4. Use the vector store for semantic search across all 485 notes
