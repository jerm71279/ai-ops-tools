## Graph View Controls

### Filters Panel (Right Side)
Click **"Filters"** to access:

**Search:**
- Type keywords to highlight matching notes
- Example: "policy" shows all policy docs

**Tags:**
- Filter by tags like `#it-services`, `#engineering`

**Groups:**
Create color-coded groups:
1. Click "+ New group"
2. Enter search term (e.g., "sales")
3. Pick a color
4. All notes matching that term will be colored

### Display Panel (Right Side)
Adjust visualization:

- **Node size**: Make important notes bigger
- **Link distance**: Spread out or cluster nodes
- **Repel force**: Push nodes apart
- **Link thickness**: Make connections more/less visible
- **Fade threshold**: Fade out distant connections

### Useful Settings to Try

**View only one team:**
1. Click **Filters**
2. In "Search" box, type team name (e.g., "engineering")
3. Check "Show orphans" OFF to hide unconnected notes

**See hub notes:**
1. Enable **"Node size"** 
2. Set to "Based on links"
3. Larger nodes = more connections

**Color by team:**
1. Create 4 groups:
   - Group 1: Search "policy" → Blue (IT Services)
   - Group 2: Search "network OR configuration" → Red (Engineering)
   - Group 3: Search "install OR construction" → Green (Plant)
   - Group 4: Search "sales OR proposal" → Yellow (Sales)

## Example Connections Added

### IT Services Example
**OberaConnect_LLC.md** now links to:
- Authentication_and_Identity_Management_Policy
- Customer_Onboarding__Offboarding_Policy
- Continuous_Monitoring_Policy
- IT_Service_Management_ITSM_Policy
- Remote_Access_Policy

### Engineering Example
**Domain Controller Migration** links to:
- Network configuration docs
- Technical handoff documentation
- Infrastructure transition guides

## Interactive Features

**Click any node** to:
- Open that note
- See its immediate connections highlighted

**Hover over a node** to:
- See the note title
- Preview connections

**Drag nodes** to:
- Rearrange the graph
- Create custom layouts

**Zoom**:
- Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- Click and drag background to pan

## Local Graph View

For a focused view of a single note:

1. Open any note
2. Click **"Open local graph"** (three dots menu → "Open local graph")
3. See only that note and its immediate connections

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Start with filters** - The full graph of 316 notes can be overwhelming
✅ **Use groups** - Color-code by team for clarity  
✅ **Focus on hubs** - Large nodes are your most connected documents
✅ **Combine with canvas** - Use canvas for curated views, graph for discovery
✅ **Local graph for detail** - When exploring one topic

## Refresh Graph

If you don't see connections:
1. Close and reopen Obsidian
2. Click the refresh icon in graph view
3. Check that notes have "Related Notes" section at bottom

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the graph** - Click around to discover connections
2. **Identify knowledge gaps** - Orphan nodes = isolated information
3. **Add more links** - Manually connect related notes as you discover them
4. **Create MOCs** - Make "Map of Content" notes linking to topic clusters
