# Phase 3: Pre-Configuration & Preparation
## After Quote Signed, Before Installation

1. Complete equipment procurement: Billing issues NRC invoice, VP Plant purchases equipment, validate receipts, categorize in QBO, equipment delivered and added to SmartSheets as "Assigned/Pending Install"

2. Communicate with carrier to obtain Estimated Completion Date (ECD), Firm Order Commitment (FOC), receive IP information, and update Circuit Inventory SmartSheet

3. Create configuration templates for SonicWall base configuration (zones, NAT, VPN, IPS), MikroTik base configuration (firewall, DHCP, DNS), and UniFi configuration (VLANs, WiFi, firewall rules)

4. Configure all devices in lab environment: set management IPs, configure VLANs and trunking, apply security policies, set up wireless controller and SSIDs, configure monitoring/management access (SNMP, syslog)

5. Conduct lab testing and validation: test internet connectivity, verify VLAN routing, test wireless SSIDs, validate security rules, test VPN connectivity (if applicable), and document performance baseline

6. Create configuration backups: export SonicWall configuration, save MikroTik .rsc backup, backup UniFi site, and store all configs in password vault/SharePoint

7. Complete Pre-Config Test Report and obtain Engineering Lead approval (Quality Gate 2: Pre-Configuration Validation)

8. Schedule installation: confirm date/time with customer, confirm team availability, update Outlook Support Calendar, update OneBill ticket with install date, and complete Installation Readiness Checklist

9. Conduct customer pre-install briefing: confirm installation timeline, confirm downtime window (if any), send user notification, designate on-site contact, and set post-install expectations

10. Day before install final checklist: review project checklist, confirm all equipment and materials loaded, confirm team ready, and verify site access arrangements
