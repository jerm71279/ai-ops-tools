# Phase 2: Recommendation & Design
## After Discovery, Before SOW Quote

1. Select core router/firewall (SonicWall TZ/NSa/NSsp, MikroTik hEX S/CCR, or UniFi Gateway UDM/UDM-Pro/UXG) based on throughput, features, and budget requirements

2. Design VLAN and IP addressing scheme: Management VLAN 10 (10.x.10.0/24), User/Data VLANs 20+, Voice VLAN 30 (10.x.30.0/24), Guest VLAN 40 (10.x.40.0/24), IoT/Security VLAN 50 (10.x.50.0/24)

3. Plan wireless network architecture including SSID naming, security (WPA3/WPA2), AP coverage map with floor plan, and minimum -67dBm signal strength target

4. Design security policies including firewall zone-based rules, access control lists, guest portal requirements, VPN requirements, and application control

5. Plan redundancy and failover including dual WAN, switch stacking, power redundancy (dual PSU, UPS), and UniFi controller backup

6. Create proposed network topology diagram showing all recommended devices, VLAN segmentation, redundancy paths, and labeled connections

7. Conduct customer design review meeting to present topology, review VLAN design, explain security policies, walk through wireless coverage map, and review project timeline

8. Obtain customer design approval with signed Design Approval Document (Quality Gate 1)

9. Develop naming conventions for devices using Location-Type-Number format (e.g., HQ-SW-01) consistent across all platforms

10. Create quote in OneBill including all equipment, licensing, labor, installation timeline, and terms
