# Phase 4: Installation Day
## On-Site Install

1. Complete physical installation: rack mount equipment, run and terminate cabling, mount access points, connect power (PoE, UPS), and apply device labels with IPs

2. Configure and cutover: connect to each device and verify config, upload final configurations, establish internet connectivity, configure inter-VLAN routing, and verify wireless network operation

3. Test connectivity from each VLAN: Management VLAN, User/Data VLANs, Voice VLAN (VoIP phones), Guest VLAN (internet-only), and IoT/Security VLAN

4. Migrate devices to new network (if applicable): workstations, printers, VoIP phones, servers and static IP devices, and test application connectivity

5. Conduct comprehensive network testing: verify internet from all VLANs, test DNS resolution, confirm DHCP functioning on all VLANs

6. Validate wireless (if applicable): verify all APs online and broadcasting, confirm signal strength ≥ -67dBm in all coverage areas, test roaming between APs, verify guest portal functionality

7. Perform security validation: test firewall rules (allow/deny), confirm guest network isolation, test VPN connectivity (if configured)

8. Complete performance testing: run speed tests from multiple locations, document baseline performance, test critical applications, and complete Installation QA Report with 100% pass (Quality Gate 3)

9. Upload documentation: close-out pictures to SharePoint, cable certifications to SharePoint, update inventory to "Installed" in SmartSheets, update network diagram with any changes (as-built)

10. Conduct customer installation walkthrough: demonstrate network functionality, show WiFi coverage and speeds, review security features, explain user access methods, provide admin credentials (secure method), answer questions, and obtain Customer Installation Sign-Off (Quality Gate 4)
