# Phase 1: Network Discovery & Assessment
## Onsite Pre-Sales

1. Schedule discovery session with customer and prepare site survey checklist and tools

2. Document current network topology including existing devices (SonicWall, MikroTik, UniFi), IP addressing scheme, VLAN structure, and internet connection details

3. Assess physical infrastructure including cabling (Cat5e/6, fiber), rack space, AP mounting locations, and power availability (PoE, UPS)

4. Gather business requirements including user count, bandwidth needs, guest network requirements, and security/compliance requirements

5. Conduct wireless site survey (if applicable) using UniFi WiFiman app with minimum -67dBm signal strength target, determine AP placement, and plan channel allocation

6. Analyze traffic patterns, bandwidth utilization, identify bottlenecks, and determine QoS requirements

7. Document security gaps and vulnerabilities including current firewall rules, security policies, and potential weaknesses

8. Identify single points of failure and document critical dependencies, backup internet needs, and redundant gateway requirements

9. Create network diagram (current state) documenting existing topology and all device connections

10. Document findings report with site survey summary, current state assessment, identified issues, and risks
