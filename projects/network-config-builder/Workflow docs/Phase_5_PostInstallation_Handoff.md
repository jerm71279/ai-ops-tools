## Final Handoff & Ongoing Support Setup

1. Configure network monitoring: enable SNMP v2c/v3 on all devices, set up monitoring in NinjaOne RMM, configure email alerts (SonicWall, UniFi, MikroTik), enable syslog forwarding, set log retention periods, and test alert delivery

2. Add all devices to management platform: add to NinjaOne RMM, configure SNMP monitoring, set up device health checks, configure automated alerts, ensure UniFi controller accessible, and set up automatic backups

3. Prepare customer documentation package including technical documentation (as-built diagram, IP address spreadsheet, VLAN documentation, WiFi details, equipment list, warranty/license dates)

7. Monitor network for first 24-48 hours: check for errors or warnings, review SonicWall/UniFi/MikroTik logs, optimize wireless channels if needed, adjust QoS policies if needed

8. Complete project closeout: reassign ticket to OPM for closeout, complete all OneBill ticket notes, archive project documentation, update customer records in PSA/CRM

9. Schedule and conduct 30-day follow-up review: meet with customer, address any outstanding issues, review network performance, gather feedback, make necessary adjustments, and document lessons learned
