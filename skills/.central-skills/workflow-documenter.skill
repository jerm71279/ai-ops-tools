        └── ...
```

### 4. Export Capabilities

Export documentation to multiple formats:

**For Editing (Obsidian):**
- Keep as `.md` files with relative image paths
- Obsidian displays images inline automatically
- Easy to edit and version control

**For Distribution (Clients/SharePoint):**
- Export to PDF using `pandoc` or Obsidian's PDF export
- Export to HTML with embedded images
- Export to Word/DOCX for SharePoint editing

**Export Commands:**
```bash
# Markdown to PDF (with embedded screenshots)
pandoc workflow.md -o workflow.pdf --embed-resources --pdf-engine=xelatex

# Markdown to HTML (self-contained)
pandoc workflow.md -o workflow.html --self-contained

# Markdown to Word
pandoc workflow.md -o workflow.docx
```

## Using the Workflow Recorder

A Python-based workflow recorder is provided to automate screenshot capture:

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the recorder
python3 workflow-recorder.py --name "unifi-vlan-setup" --department "IT"

# Use hotkeys while working:
# F9 - Take screenshot and advance step
# F10 - Add note to current step
# ESC - Stop recording and generate documentation
```

### Recorder Features

- **Hotkey-based screenshot capture:** Press F9 to capture the current screen
- **Automatic step numbering:** Each screenshot is numbered sequentially
- **Window title detection:** Captures what application you're working in
- **Markdown generation:** Creates a template with all screenshots embedded
- **Organized output:** Creates proper directory structure automatically

### Manual Screenshot Workflow

If not using the recorder:

1. Take screenshots manually (Windows: Win+Shift+S, Linux: Flameshot)
2. Save to `screenshots/[workflow-name]/` directory
3. Name files descriptively: `step1-login.png`, `step2-create-vlan.png`
4. Reference in Markdown using relative paths

## Integration with Your Tools

### Obsidian
- Store all `.md` files in your Obsidian vault
- Use internal links: `[[related-workflow]]`
- Tag workflows: `#sop #network #unifi`
- Create MOCs (Maps of Content) for workflow categories

### SharePoint
- Export workflows to PDF for upload
- Use Word export for collaborative editing
- Maintain `.md` files in Git for version control
- Publish final versions to SharePoint library

### NotebookLM
- Upload completed workflow Markdown files
- NotebookLM can answer questions about your processes
- Use for training new team members
- Create workflow summaries and quick reference guides

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive screenshot filenames**
   - ✅ `step3-create-vlan-interface.png`
   - ❌ `screenshot1.png`

2. **Keep workflows focused**
   - One workflow = One task/objective
   - Break complex processes into multiple related workflows

3. **Update regularly**
   - Add "Last Updated" date to each document
   - Review quarterly or after system changes
   - Mark deprecated workflows clearly

4. **Use consistent formatting**
   - Follow the provided templates
   - Use the same heading structure
   - Maintain naming conventions

5. **Link related workflows**
   - Reference prerequisite workflows
   - Link to follow-up procedures
   - Create workflow maps for complex processes

## Example: Network Configuration Workflow

```markdown
# UniFi VLAN Setup for Guest Network

**Document Information:**
- Department: IT
- Created: 2025-01-15
- Last Updated: 2025-01-15
- Owner: Network Team
- Related Docs: [[firewall-rules-guest-vlan]], [[dhcp-configuration]]

## Overview
This workflow creates a segregated guest network VLAN on UniFi equipment to provide internet-only access for visitors without access to internal resources.

## Prerequisites
- UniFi controller access (admin role)
- Network plan with VLAN ID and IP range
- Understanding of basic networking concepts

## Steps

### Step 1: Login to UniFi Controller
![UniFi Controller Login Screen](screenshots/unifi-vlan-setup/step1-login.png)

**What to do:**
1. Navigate to https://unifi.ui.com or your local controller IP
2. Enter administrator credentials
3. Select the correct site if managing multiple locations

**Notes:**
- Use 2FA if enabled
- Ensure you have admin rights, not just read-only access

### Step 2: Access Network Settings
![Network Settings Menu](screenshots/unifi-vlan-setup/step2-network-menu.png)

**What to do:**
1. Click "Settings" in the bottom left
2. Select "Networks" from the menu
3. Click "Create New Network"

### Step 3: Configure Guest VLAN
![VLAN Configuration Screen](screenshots/unifi-vlan-setup/step3-create-vlan.png)

**What to do:**
1. Set Name: "Guest Network"
2. Set VLAN ID: 100 (or per your network plan)
3. Configure Gateway/Subnet: 192.168.100.1/24
4. Enable DHCP with range: 192.168.100.10 - 192.168.100.254
5. Enable "Guest Policy" to isolate from main network

**Notes:**
- VLAN ID must be unique and not conflict with existing VLANs
- Guest Policy automatically creates firewall rules

### Step 4: Apply and Verify
![Network List with New VLAN](screenshots/unifi-vlan-setup/step4-verify.png)

**What to do:**
1. Click "Save" to apply configuration
2. Wait for provisioning to complete (30-60 seconds)
3. Verify new network appears in network list

## Verification

Test connectivity:
1. Connect a device to the guest SSID (if wireless configured)
2. Verify device receives IP in 192.168.100.x range
3. Test internet connectivity: `ping 8.8.8.8`
4. Verify isolation: Attempt to ping internal resource (should fail)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Devices not getting IP addresses**
- Check DHCP is enabled and range is valid
- Verify no DHCP conflicts with other networks
- Check switch ports are configured for VLAN tagging

**Issue: No internet access**
- Verify firewall rules allow guest VLAN outbound
- Check WAN failover settings
- Review traffic rules and port forwarding

- Organizes as troubleshooting workflow
- Includes verification steps and rollback procedures

**"Build a client onboarding checklist for new managed services customers"**
- Generates sales/support hybrid template
- Includes stakeholder sections
- Creates handoff documentation format

## Advanced Features

### Automated Screenshot Annotations

The recorder can add basic annotations:
```bash
python3 workflow-recorder.py --name "process" --annotate
# Adds click indicators and step numbers to screenshots
```

### Batch Export

Convert all workflows to PDF:
```bash
python3 batch-export.py --format pdf --input documentation/workflows --output exports/
```

### Template Customization

Create custom templates for recurring workflows:
```bash
python3 create-template.py --name "mikrotik-config" --base network-config
```

## Quick Reference

### Markdown Image Syntax
```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.png)
![Optional title](screenshots/workflow-name/step1.png "Tooltip text")
```

### Common Export Formats
- **PDF:** Best for client deliverables and official documentation
- **HTML:** Good for web publishing or SharePoint
- **Word:** Needed for collaborative editing in Microsoft environments
- **Markdown:** Best for version control and internal editing

### Hotkey Summary (Recorder)
- `F9` - Capture screenshot and advance step
- `F10` - Add note to current step
- `F11` - Insert section break
- `ESC` - Stop recording and generate documentation
- `Ctrl+Z` - Delete last screenshot

## Notes

- All generated documentation is stored in `documentation/workflows/`
- Screenshots are organized in `documentation/screenshots/[workflow-name]/`
- Export outputs go to `exports/` directory
- Templates are stored in `templates/`
- This skill works alongside the workflow recorder Python script
- Compatible with Git for version control
