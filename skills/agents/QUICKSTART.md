# Getting Started with Agents

## What Are Agents?

Think of agents like **specialized assistants**. Instead of one helper trying to do everything, you have a team:

- Need to **find something**? Ask the Explorer
- Need to **plan a project**? Ask the Planner
- Need to **run a command**? Ask the Commander

Each one is tuned for their job, so you get faster, better results.

## The Only Thing You Need to Know

**Type `/agents` in Claude Code.**

That's it. You'll see a list of available helpers and what each one does.

## Quick Examples

### "I need to find where something is"

Just ask:
> "Find where the login code is"

Claude will automatically use the **Explorer** agent to search for you.

### "I want to plan something before building it"

Just ask:
> "Help me plan how to add a contact form"

Claude will use the **Planner** agent to think it through first.

### "I need to run something"

Just ask:
> "Run the tests" or "Check git status"

Claude will use the **Commander** agent to execute it.

## Which Agent Does What?

| When You Need To... | Agent Used | What It Does |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| Find files or code | **Explorer** | Searches your project fast |
| Plan before building | **Planner** | Creates a step-by-step approach |
| Run commands | **Commander** | Executes git, npm, etc. |
| Ask about Claude Code | **Guide** | Answers "how do I..." questions |
| Complex research | **Researcher** | Digs deep, multiple steps |
| Business strategy | **Strategist** | Market research, planning |

## You Don't Need To...

- Install anything extra (slash commands work immediately)
- Learn any technical terms
- Memorize agent names (Claude picks the right one)
- Configure anything

Just describe what you want. Claude handles the rest.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know which agent to use?**

You don't have to. Just describe your task, and Claude picks the right helper. If you want to see options, type `/agents`.

**Q: What if I pick the wrong one?**

No problem - just describe what you actually need, and Claude will adjust.

**Q: Do I need to set anything up?**

No. The `/agents` command works immediately in Claude Code.

**Q: What's the difference between "haiku" and "opus"?**

Don't worry about it. These are just speed vs. depth settings that Claude manages automatically.

## Want More Control?

If you want to get specific, you can type:

- `/agents` - See all available agents
- `/agent-show explorer` - Learn more about one agent
- `/agent-suggest "my task here"` - Get a recommendation

But honestly? Just describe what you need. Claude's got it.

## Need Help?

If something isn't working:

1. Make sure you're in Claude Code (the terminal app, not the website)
2. Type `/agents` to verify commands are working
3. Try describing your task in plain words

Still stuck? Just ask: "Help me understand how to use agents"
