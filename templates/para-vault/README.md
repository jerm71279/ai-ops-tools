# PARA Vault Templates

Templates for setting up a PARA-organized Obsidian vault.

## What is PARA?

A Personal Knowledge Management framework by Tiago Forte:

| Folder | Contains | Key Question |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **1_Projects** | Active work with deadlines | What am I committed to finishing? |
| **2_Areas** | Ongoing responsibilities | What standards am I maintaining? |
| **3_Resources** | Reference material | What might I need someday? |
| **4_Archives** | Inactive items | What's done or no longer relevant? |

## Templates Included

### Core Templates
- `Home.md` - Vault dashboard/home page
- `Project Template.md` - For new projects
- `Area Template.md` - For new areas
- `Weekly Review.md` - Weekly review checklist
- `Win Log.md` - Track wins for career progression

### Pre-built Areas
- `Leadership Development.md` - Career growth tracking
- `Team Management.md` - People/delegation practice
- `AI Development.md` - AI tools and automation
- `MSP Operations.md` - Day-to-day operations

## Quick Setup

1. Create folders: `1_Projects/`, `2_Areas/`, `3_Resources/`, `4_Archives/`, `Templates/`
2. Copy these templates to `Templates/`
3. Copy area files to `2_Areas/[Area Name]/`
4. Open `Home.md` as your starting point

## Key Metric

**Weekly Actionable Outputs** - Count business-moving actions from your vault each week.

Target: 3+ per week. If below 3, the system is becoming a distraction.

## Grok's Warning

> "If you're spending hours tweaking folders instead of doing uncomfortable leadership work, you're procrastinating."
