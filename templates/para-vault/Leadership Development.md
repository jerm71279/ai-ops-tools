**Type:** Area (ongoing responsibility)
**Standard to maintain:** Consistent growth toward management role

## My Goal
Move from technical individual contributor (Network Engineer) to a management/leadership role.

## Current Gaps (Be Honest)
- [ ] Strategic thinking vs. tactical execution
- [ ] People management experience
- [ ] Visibility with decision-makers
- [ ] Communication with non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] Delegation skills

## Path to Management Checklist
*Based on Grok's coaching - things within my control*

### Build Internal Influence
- [ ] Schedule 1:1 with manager about management aspirations
- [ ] Ask for feedback on leadership potential from 2-3 peers
- [ ] Volunteer to lead a project or initiative
- [ ] Propose one strategic idea per month to leadership

### Develop People Skills
- [ ] Mentor a junior team member (formally or informally)
- [ ] Practice having difficult conversations
- [ ] Learn to translate tech-speak to business value
- [ ] Document team processes (shows leadership thinking)

### Increase Visibility
- [ ] Speak up in meetings with strategic insights (not just technical)
- [ ] Share knowledge in internal forums/channels
- [ ] Build relationships outside my immediate team
- [ ] Track and communicate my wins (use Win Log)

## Books / Resources to Study
- [ ] "The Making of a Manager" - Julie Zhuo

## Grok's Accountability Questions
*Review weekly - be honest*

1. Am I hiding in technical work to avoid leadership discomfort?
2. What uncomfortable action did I take this week?
3. Does my manager know I want to move into leadership?
